# personal_finance_tracker_DS-repo

The Personal Finance Tracker is a data science project built using a Jupyter Notebook to help individuals manage their personal finances more effectively. It focuses on tracking, analyzing, and visualizing income and expenses over time to provide a clear understanding of spending habits and financial health.

The project begins by importing financial transaction data, typically from sources like CSV or Excel files. This data is then cleaned to handle missing or incorrect entries, ensuring accuracy in the analysis. Dates are converted into appropriate formats, and each transaction is classified as either income or expense.

Once the data is clean, it is categorized into common spending groups such as food, transport, entertainment, salary, savings, and more. This categorization makes it easier for users to see where their money is going and identify spending patterns.

The notebook also generates monthly and yearly summaries. It calculates key figures such as total income, total expenses, and total savings for each month or year. Additional statistics like the average monthly spending, savings rate, and budget deviations are also provided to give users deeper financial insights.

To make the information more understandable, the project uses data visualization techniques. Graphs such as bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts are used to display trends over time, show the breakdown of expenses by category, and compare income versus expenses.

Finally, the project delivers actionable insights. It identifies high-spending categories, highlights months with the lowest or highest savings, and helps users monitor their progress toward financial goals. By presenting data in a visual and organized manner, this finance tracker serves as a valuable tool for budgeting, saving, and improving overall money management.

Overall, this project demonstrates how data science can be applied to everyday life to make smarter financial decisions and develop better spending habits.
